# Reviews

A simple React app that reads and displays the dummy data contained in a file in the form of an array of objects (this data puports to be the photo, id-number, name, job and text contribution of the "reviewers"). The user can scroll to the previous or the next review by clicking on the "<" or the ">" buttons, or can go to a random review by clicking on the "Surprise Me" button.

The app is based on the eponimous project that appears in the tutorial [Code 15 React Projects - Complete Course](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo) by freeCodeCamp.org.
